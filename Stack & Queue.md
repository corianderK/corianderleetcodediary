## 1) Using list

__Stack__ works on the principle of __“Last-in, first-out”__. Also, the inbuilt functions in Python make the code short and simple. To add an item to the top of the list, i.e., to push an item, we use append() function and to pop out an element we use pop() function. These functions work quiet efficiently and fast in end operations.

__Queue__ works on the principle of __“First-in, first-out”__. Below is list implementation of queue. We use pop(0) to remove the first item from a list.

## 2) Using Deque

In case of stack, list implementation works fine and provides both __append() and pop()__ in O(1) time. When we use deque implementation, we get same time complexity.

When using __queue() and deque()__, you can also play with __popleft()__.
